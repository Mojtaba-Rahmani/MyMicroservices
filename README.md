<h1> Microservice in .NET Core </h1>
<br>
<h3> Sample of Microservices </h3>
<br>
<p>
As companies grow, the development of web-based software can become challenging and can even hinder their growth. Using a principled and tested architecture, such as Microservices, can significantly improve a company's progress and development.
<br>
In this Sample, we will explore Microservices architecture in ASP.NET Core and implement it step by step.
